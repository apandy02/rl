    "## Generalized Policy Iteration \n",
    "We write two algorithms as functions to be used with generic MDPs. The first of these is Policy iteration, and the second is Value iteration. Both of these methods are instances of Generalized Policy Iteration algorithms, where we evaluate a policy, then make the policy greedy with respect to the value function. "
