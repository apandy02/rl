# Reinforcement Learning
This repository contains implementations of various reinforcement learning algorithms in Python 3.9. These implementations are created as part of my self-study of the UCL/Deepmind course on Reinforcement Learning available on YouTube, as well as reading through Sutton and Barto's textbook "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction"

## Directory Structure
The repository contains the following directories:

### DynamicProgramming
This directory contains implementations of two dynamic programming algorithms:

- Policy Iteration
- Value Iteration

The implementations are available as Jupyter notebooks.

### Monte Carlo Methods
This directory contains implementations of Monte Carlo methods:

- On-policy Monte Carlo Control
- SARSA
- Q-learning

The implementations are available as Jupyter notebooks and make use of OpenAI gym.

## Requirements
To run the Jupyter notebooks, you will need to have Python 3.9 installed, as well as the following libraries:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- gym


These libraries can be installed using pip.

## How to Use
To use the implementations in this repository, simply clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebooks in the relevant directories. The notebooks contain explanations of the algorithms and how to use them.
