# Policy Based Methods 

In this subdirectory we explore different policy optimization techniques. In these algorithms, we directly optimize the policy being learned, in contrast to Value based methods in which we maintain and update an estimate of the value function. Some examples of such methods (which either have been or are to be implemented) are REINFORCE, Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
